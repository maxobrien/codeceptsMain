One important thing to do is to download all of your images from the web. Instead of linking out to other websites, you should download all of your images. If you link out to other websites the image could be taken down and then some of your app or program would consequently break. The way you can get around this is to download all of your images and put them inside an images folder. On our website we have a resources folder and inside that we have sub directories for our stylesheets and images. This gives us an easy place to store our files which makes sense. This also means that if someone looked through our code it would be simple for them to understand.
