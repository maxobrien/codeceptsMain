So to start off we have one of the most important part of coding - commenting. Commenting allows you to tell yourself or others what a part of your code does. A comment can be anything, it doesnâ€™t affect the code. It allows you to identify specific bits of code which may not be obvious without the comment. An example for this would be a random line break in your code. This might not be obvious to what it does but if you write a simple comment explaining what it does it will make navigating your code a lot easier.
