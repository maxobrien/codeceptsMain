One way to do this is to write it your self.  But that is just boring!  As they say; ‘A good coder writes his own code, an expert coder steals other peoples’.  Now lots of people in this world write code that is open source in the form of an API.  This API normally has lots of functions that you can call in your own code, and these functions are what adds the new functionality to your own program.
