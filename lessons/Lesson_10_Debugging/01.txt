One of the most important things to remember when you are writing a program is debugging.  You wonâ€™t always get things right, but you will get an error.  So what does this error mean?  How do you fix it?  Well normally in an error you get what line number is broken.  This is the first thing to look at.  Go back to your code and check to see if you can see what the error is.  If you can they thumbs up to you, but what if it is even harder than this?  You can debug you code.
