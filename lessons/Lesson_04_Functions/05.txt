In lesson one we talked about **variables**, these can be used with functions. Some people like to have milk in their tea but some people prefer not to. This could be set using a **boolean** variable (a true or false variable). Inside the function we can have a rule which runs if the person wants milk. Likewise people like different amounts of milk. This amount could be set by a **number** variable, this amount of milk would then be added to the cup of tea.

These variables are called parameters and change the output everytime the function is run. However, you only have to write the function once instead of once for each option. These parameters are written when calling the function. This is just one example of how a function could be adapted to be used more broadly, there are many more. This shows us how versatile a function is and how it could be used.
