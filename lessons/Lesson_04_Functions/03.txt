A basic use of a function is to take an **input**, run it through some algorithms or a set of rules and then return an **output** at the end. So when we call the function we can have inputs such as the teabag and mug in the case of our example. The teabag and mug then get mixed with water and heated up to make a cup of tea. The teabag, mug and water are our inputs and the cup of tea is our output.
