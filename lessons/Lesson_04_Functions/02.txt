However bad this story might be it shows us exactly how a **function** works in any programming language. A function is a place to write a set of instructions which are carried out when we call or run the function. This means that we can call it many different times, in different places, like in my home or my friends. In this case our **function** makes a cup of tea and has a list of instructions inside. This list can be small or large, it doesn't matter. It is important to note however that a function will run code inside of it in the order you write it but we will worry about that later.
