Let's start this lesson off with a story. I want to make a cup of tea. I list out all of the steps on a piece of paper and when I make it I simply follow the steps, in order. If I want to make another cup of tea then I can just follow the set of instructions again. The instructions I put down are so general that I can use it anywhere so when I go to a friends house I can also make a cup of tea if I know where to get water, where a kettle is and I have a mug and teabag.
