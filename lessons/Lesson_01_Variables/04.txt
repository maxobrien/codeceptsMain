###Data Types:

Variables store information of all types but sometimes you have to tell the computer more specifically, after all the computer doesnâ€™t understand what you mean unless you tell it. One of the most basic types of variables is a **number**. In some languages there are different names of variables for different sizes and kinds of number such as decimals or very large numbers but this will be covered in the crash course if needed in that language.
