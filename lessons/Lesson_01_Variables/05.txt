Next we have **strings**. These are segments of text that can be stored in a variable. These could be used to store the users name, to get a highscore or anything else. This text could be set to anything, including special characters (@, !, #, ?).

Next there are **booleans**. These are really simple variables but have a complicated name. They are just a true or false statement. They can be used store on or off switches to show sections of a website or used to tell the computer whether you have run out of ammunition on a game. As with all variables they can be set to do anything. **Booleans** may be written using a system of 1s and 0s which is how a computer is programmed fundamentally. However this will sometimes change depending on the language, so refer to the crash course for that particular language.
