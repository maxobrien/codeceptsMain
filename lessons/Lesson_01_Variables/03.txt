For now you don't need to worry about how to make variables, but just take note that the code says to make a variable by saying 'var' and then has to give it a name, in this case 'Variable1'.  One thing about these names though is that they have to be **unique**. Not all programming languages will form variables in the same way and to get the syntax (how you form it) take a crash course.
