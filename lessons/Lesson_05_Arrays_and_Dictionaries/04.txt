An array is just a list of values, what happens however if you want to store a value against a name. We could store the test scores each student gets next to their name. To do this we would need a dictionary. A dictionary allows us to store a value against a piece of data inside an array. This is just like a dictionary, it has a word and a definition. That word can be set to anything and the definition can be anything else. That might seem confusing but this image should help.
