The final type of loops are **count-controlled loops**. These are loops controlled by an increasing integer. This allows you to run a piece of code a specific number of times and then stop. It also allows you to run a piece of code with different numbers counting up. An example of when you would use one of these loops is if you were trying to draw a square. You have to draw a line of a certain length then turn 90 degrees, draw another line of the same length, turn 90 degrees again. You would then have to draw another line of the same length, turn 90 degrees and draw a final line of 90 degrees. Using a loop you could just count up to four and run the code to draw the line and rotate four times. This would decrease the size of your code by over half and would decrease it significantly more if you were trying to draw a more complicated shape such as a decagon (10 sided shape) or a dodecagon (12 sided shape).
